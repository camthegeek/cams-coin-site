**Translating the Masari website**

English is the primary language across multiple projects worldwide. All translations should be based upon their English version.

Main language file:
- _i18n/en.yml

The Masari website is designed and developed to have sections that can easily be edited, updated, removed and translated in an organized manner. This resulted in having multiple sections with multiple files that contain content.
The following files can also be translated. Each file represents a different area in each section.

- _data/en/downloads/android.yml
- _data/en/downloads/linux.yml
- _data/en/downloads/mac.yml
- _data/en/downloads/windows.yml
- _data/en/research/00-wwhm.yml
- _data/en/research/01-SECOR.yml

After translating the above files, the majority of the front page content should be translated. The Masari guides are pulled from an external repository at this current time. Accessing our site at /guides will result in English only content (but will have everything else translated).
